This is a repository for Tyler Higley's 2015 Computer Science Senior Thesis Project. 

###Abstract
The goal of this project is to write from scratch a simple minimally functional Operating System for the x86 architecture using C and Assembly Language. The design and implementation will take primary inspiration from Unix as well as similar minimal/educational Operating Systems projects such as Minix and Xinu. In the process I will attempt to educate myself in the field of Operating Systems and develop a closer understanding of what goes on in the layers between the hardware and user applications. If successful this project should not only be at least minimally usable for simple tasks, but also fill the role of an educational tool for others wishing to learn about Operating System concepts, design, and implementation.

###Progress
The current version has much much of the command line user interface worked out, but non of the real functionality.
